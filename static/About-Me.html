            In making my own blog, I could not decide on what type of blog I would want or a topic a could elaborate own
            much. Then I looked over at some flowers my husband had brought home for me and I thought a floral blog
            could be nice.

            My love for flowers; An extention of my love for gardening.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Although I do love to receive flowers as gifts. I really think I can appreciate them more because I garden
            myself and understand the amount of work and effort that goes into growing anything. And I understand just
            how bleak harvestign can be when something goes wrong. However, with flowers the are a physical of the fact
            that something can come from what seems like nothing. Not only something but a beautiful something.

            I am just a young woman who enjoys gardening along with many of my other hobbies; like learning to be a
            frontend web developer in my space time. While a task like that can bring great stress gardening and looking
            at my flowers simply reminders me to slow down and take a moment.
